# Transport Optimisation

Clustering has been used to arrive at optimal bus stops to transport employees of a company
Constraints:

Number of Employees= 2000

Bus Stop Options = 120

Maximum Bus Stops= 10

Possible Bus Stop Combinations= 116,068,180,000,000

## Solution

In the below map:
- Magenta = Employee address
- Light green = Potential bus stops
- Dark Green = Centroid of each cluster
- Pink Border = The bus stop nearest to each centroid
